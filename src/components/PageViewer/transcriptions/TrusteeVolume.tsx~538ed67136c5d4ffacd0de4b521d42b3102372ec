            understanding that so much of the interest as may accrue from the

          <aside>Scholarships.</aside>
          <p>
            The committee on the subject of scholarships offered the following
            report which was adopted.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;On the subject of scholarships, your committee report in favor of
            an entire change in the policy of the Board. They are satisfied that
            without ample endowment the College can never rise to its appropriate
            position among Sister institutions of the State.  They beleive [sic]
            also that it will be difficult, if not impossible within in a few years,
            to secure, as a gratuity, a sufficient sum to place it on a firm basis.
            It is therefore deemed expedient greatly to reduce the price of
            scholarships. Nor is this, in the history of Colleges, an untried
            experiment. Bethany College and Hampden Sidney of our own State have
            adopted the measure with success. The latter institution has already, in
            this way, secured about seventy thousand dollars. It is therefore
            recommended by your committee to reduce the price of scholarships, in
            Richmond College, so as to bring them within the reach of all classes in
            the community. The following scheme is proposed for the adoption of the
            Trustees.
          </p>
          <ol style={{ listStylePosition: "inside" }}>
            <li className='first'>That scholarships at $50, each, not exceeding 2000 in number be
              hereby offered to the friends of Education.</li>
            <li className='second'>Any person paying in cash to the President and Trustees of
              Richmond College, the sum of Fifty dollars shall be entitled to one
              scholarship, and for every additional $50, another share in the scheme
              shall be held.</li>
            <li className='third'>Each scholarship shall entitle one person &amp; only one to a full
              course of instruction in said Richmond College, and its preparatory
              departments.</li>
            <li className='fourth'>Any individual holding a scholarship may, by it, himself pass
              through a course of study or send his own son or the son of another, at
              any period within thirty years from the time when the operation of the
              scheme shall commence. Tuition being given to one person by virtue of a
              scholarship, the scholarship shall thus become null and void.  A
              scholarship may be transferred by will or otherwise.</li>
            <li className='fifth'><PageNumber num={80} />This scheme shall commence operation when 1000 scholarships shall
              have been secured.</li>
            <li className='sixth'>The foregoing scheme shall not be understood to invalidate any
              privilege or right secured by the system of scholarships heretofore
              adopted by the Trustees of the College.&quot;</li>

            <li className='first'>—That it is inexpedient at present to remove the the [sic] College,
              and that should the question be hereafter agitated, it will not be
              decided without consulting the friends and patrons throughout the state.</li>
            <li>—As no change in the present organization of the College can be made
              without an increased Endowment, and as the effort now about to be made
              to collect funds cannot be available for the ensuing sessions, we think
              that it is unnecessary at present to recommend any change.  But where
              the condition of the<PageNumber num={97} />
              finances of the College shall justify it, we think the whole system of
              management should be carefully reviewed, and a better organization
              adopted.</li>
            <li>We have not been able to procure accurate information on the subject
              of Scholarships, but we think that unless funds cannot otherwise be
              collected, it is unwise to adopt the Scholarship plan.  It might at
              first, by reducing education below its real cost, give an impulse to our
              operations, but in the end would embarrass the institution.</li>

            On motion of A. Thomas, a committee consisting of Dr. Howell, A.M.
            Poindexter and B. Manly Jr. was appointed to draft a plan for the
            raising of the proposed Endowment and to report to an adjourned meeting

The above balance of $406.91 will probably be reduced by the sum of $250 yet to be collected from students; leaving the ultimate deficiency about $156.91.</p>

Taylor at Richmond College.</p>
          <p>On motion resolved that the President be authorized to pay the portion of Prof. Dabney's Salary for which the Trustees are responsible, and to hold the receipt of Prof. Dabney as his Claim upon the Trustees.</p>

          <aside>Reorganization Adopted</aside>
          <p>The Committee on the reorganization of the College presented their report which having been amended was adopted as follows.</p>
          <p>The Committee to whom was referred the propriety of reorganizing the College respectfully report, while they deem it important that various changes should be made, they do not think the present state of the Endowment, and of the building and fixtures of the College will justify such a reorganization, as under other circumstances they would recommend. They therefore recommend that the subject be postponed to some future period. They would however recommend the appointment of a Committee to revise the By Laws of the the [sic] College, and also a Committee to revise the Charter.</p>
          <p>Your Committee regard instruction by Lectures as of great importance, to completeness and efficiency of Collegiate training.  They are pleased to learn upon inquiry, that to some extent the Faculty have adopted this Course of Instruction, But they consider the subject of sufficient magnitude to justify the adoption by the Board of the <PageNumber num={163} />following Resolution.</p>
          <aside>Lectures Recommended</aside>

          <p>The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved.</p>
          <PageNumber num={200} />
          <p>The President laid before the Board communication from <aside>Prof Christian Resigns</aside> Prof. H.J. Christian resigning the Chair of Greek in the College, which was accepted, and on motion the President was requested to advertise for another Professor to fill the vacant Chair, and the first Thursday (the 3thd of September) was appointed the day of election.</p>
          <p>The Committee on Legacies, etc., presented a report, through T.J. Evans, in the case of Miss Virginia Ratcliff, as follows:</p>
          <p>&quot;To the Trustees of Richmond College&quot;</p>
          <p>Gentlemen,</p>
          <p>As a member of the committee appointed to look into and make <aside>Report on Legacies</aside> report upon the bequest made by Virginia Ratcliffe [sic] to Richmond College -- I eg leave to report that the will of Virginia Ratcliffe (a certified copy of which will is herewith returned) was made on the 10th day of April 1849. She died in June 1853. On the 9th of July 1855, the will was proved and admitted to record in the Richmond Hustings Court, and A. Pleasants the Executor named in the will qualified as such on the 9th July 1855.</p>
          <p>By the will she gave the sum of $950 to Richmond College at the death of her sister Eliza Ann Brend -- This sum she said was due to her from Archibald Pleasants and was secured by a deed of trust on his house and lot, in the City of Richmond. Diligent search has been made for that deed and it cannot be found on record. Mr. Pleasants assures me no such deed ever was made.
          </p>
          <p>Eliza Ann Brend is now dead and the College is entitled to the benefit of <PageNumber num={201} /> the bequest under the will, if any such benefit is ever to accrue.</p>
          <p>Mr. Pleasants has put in my hands papers, receipts of J.H. Walthall for board of V.R., and other accounts against V.R., certified to by Eliza Ann Brend showing that the amount due from Archibald Pleasants to V. Ratcliffe in 1849 has been more than paid off -- and that at her death she was actually in debt to A Pleasants. -- There is no doubt in my own mind that this is so and I do not believe that in a suit against A. Pleasants the College could recover anything. <span style={{ float: 'right' }}>Respectfully,</span>
          </p>
          <div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}><div>(A copy signed)</div> <div>Thos. J. Evans</div></div>
          <p>On motion the report was received and the committee discharged from any further action in the case.</p>
          <p>The Board now took up the regular business of the meeting the appointment of a tutor for the Academic Department. (Present J.B. Jeter), and the applications and letters of recommendations from 24 candidates being read, proceeded to ballot, and on the first ballot <aside>Reinhart Tutor</aside> Mr. H.W. Reinhart, of Albemarle received 7 votes out of 8 cast, was declared duly elected Tutor, and the President was requested to inform him of the appointment.</p>
          <p>It having been stated to the Board by the request of A.M. Poindexter that it would be impossible for him to serve as <aside>Chairman Committee on Charter</aside> Chairman of the committee, appointed to petition the Legislature to amend the Charter of the College, on motion the President was appointed Chairman in his stead. Now adjourned.

            Prayer by Rev. L.W. Seeley, who was invited to assist in the

            <b></b>Whereas an article was published in <u>The South</u> of the 12
            inst, over the signature &quot;<u>Amicus Doulcias</u>&quot;, charging
            that the <PageNumber num={208} /> President of Richmond College, &quot;has dared and still dares to use
            his most strenous [sic] exertions for the overthrow of Slavery -- for
            sowing the seeds of Abolitionism and implanting a spirit of Northern
            fanatacism [sic] in the minds of those intrusted [sic] to his
            care&quot;, That, &quot;with a zeal that would be truly laudable in a
            more glorious enterprise, he devotes all his time and talents to the
            accomplishment of his fiendish purposes&quot;, That &quot;there are
            young men of undoubted talents and of wisdom fit to adorn much older
            heads, who have by his villanous [sic] labors alone, become so
            thoroughly imbued with his abolition principles that they do not
            hesitate to openly avow and advocate his sentiments,&quot; and whereas

            for the Character of the instruction imparted by its faculty,

            responsibility of the charges himself, Therefore Resolved 1. That from
            our long and intimate acquaintance with President Ryland, the facts that
            he is a Virginian and a slave holder, our Knowledge of his views on the
            subject of Slavary [sic] as publickly [sic] &amp; privately expressed,
            and such investigation as the brief period which has transpired since
            the said publication has permitted us to make, we unhesitatingly declare
            our belief that the said charges are wholly false.
          </p>
          <p>
            2. That for the entire satisfaction of the Public Mind we will continue <PageNumber num={209} /> our investigation, until we have arrived at as full a Knowledge of the
            grounds of these charges as we can attain, and that when said
            investigation is ended we will, without reserve, publish the result,
          </p>
          <p>
            3. That A.M. Poindexter, Jas. Thomas, and L.R. Spilman, be and they are
            hereby appointed a committee to conduct this investigation, and to
            report as soon as a thorough investigation can be made.
          </p>
          <p>
            4. That said committee are hereby instructed, to call upon the Editor of
            The South, and request him to aid them in their labor, by furnishing
            them a statement in full, of the facts and evidence upon which he bases
            the allegations of the article aforesaid.
          </p>
          <p>
            5. That the Secretary be instructed to secure the insertion of this
            preamble and resolution in The South, Whig, and Enquirer of this city.
          </p>
          <p>The following resolution offered by A.M. Poindexter was adopted.</p>
          <p>
            Resolved that the committee of investigation be and they are hereby

          </p>

          <PageNumber num={223} />

          <p>
            <b>Report</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            1st.      The question whether the present rate of board ought to be
            reduced?
          </p>

          <p>
            We deem it very desirable to reduce the board if suitable and
            responsible. Hotel keepers <aside>Hotel keeper to board of beneficiary</aside> can be obtained; but in view of all the
            difficulties, we deem it inexpedient to reduce the board, for the coming
            session.
          </p>
          <p>
            2nd.     We recommend that hereafter in lieu of the rent for the Hotels,
            the proprietors be requested to board two of the beneficiary Students;
            that is, each hotel keeper board one Student, and the treasurer of the
            fund appropriated towards the beneficiaries, be requested to retain this
            amount, and pay it over to the Treasurer of this Board.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.         That One dollar <aside>$1 for fuel</aside>, for fuel be paid to the hotel keepers for
            this session, and also for the last session, out of the $2 paid by each
            of the day scholars in the College proper for room rent.
          </p>
          <p>
            4.         We deem it desirable to increase the income of the faculty,
            and therefore offer the following resolution for your consideration,
            viz. at the earliest practicable period -- when consistent with the
            present obligations of the College, the income of the Professors be
            increased.
          </p>

            Dr. A.J. Coons from the Committee to whom was referred several
            communications from the President, B. Puryear and others, made a report,
            which being amended was adopted as follows.

          <p>
            The committee to whom was referred several communications that had been
            addressed to the Board of Trustees of the College in June 1858, beg
            leave to report further.

          <aside>Report on Steward's a/c</aside>
          <p>
            The books and accounts of Prof. Lewis Turner for the two sessions in
            <time dateTime="1859-07">1856-7</time> &amp; <time dateTime="1859-08">1857-8</time> have been carefully examined. We believe Mr.
            Turner's atcs [sic] are correct except in some very small items which we
            will presently specify. Though his manner of keeping his books is not
            clearly intelligible to your committee, and but for the kindly
            assistance of Mr. Turner, we should not have been able to make the
            proper examination.
          </p>
          <p>
            We found vouchers and receipts for all sums paid out and doubt not he
            has faithfully reported all sums collected by him.  Upon proper
            adjustment of his [indecipherable] for<time dateTime="1857-08"> 1857-8</time>  we find a balance of 50
            cents due the College.
          </p>

            The books also show 8$ in hand yet to be refunded by Mr. Turner to
            students from deposite [sic] money for<time dateTime="1887"> 1857</time> &amp;<time dateTime="1858"> 1858</time>.  It should be
            understood <PageNumber num={232} /> that this report is only up to the <time dateTime="1858-06-29"> 29th of June 1858</time>, and if anything
            has been received or paid out since this date, it is not embraced in
            this report.
          </p>
          <p>
            We would recommend that in the future Mr. Turner keep his books in more
            accountant form.  1st.  Each pupil's account of 1st &amp; 2nd payment
            should be kept on the same page.  2nd.  Students who still owe for
            tuition should appear on the books in a separate from [sic], as
            delinquents and the amount due annexed to each name.
          </p>
          <p>
            We discover that Mr. Turner has been in the habit of paying small bills
            for repairs and other work about the College. We recommend that no one
            pay any bill except our Treasurer. That the Treasurer require every bill
            properly vouched for as correct before paying it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The accounts of the President of the College, were examined by the
            regular auditing committee and hence we are relieved of the necessity of
            reporting upon Mr. Ryland's accounts though by resolution referred to
            us.
          </p>
          <p>
            The time for holding prayers and requiring the attendance of students we
            think had better be left to the judgment of the President &amp; Faculty
            and in case the Faculty cannot enforce proper discipline, it may then be
            proper for the Board of Trustees to take action in the case.

          </p>
          <p>Report.</p>
          <p>
            Whereas the President of the College is from his office its recognized
            functional head and executive officer, to whom a general superintendence
            is committed, and upon whom a general responsibility as to the Trustees,
            faculty, students and the public devolves; and whereas it is important
            to the efficiency &amp; prosperity of the College that there should be
            unity of administration, a well defined and stable policy of management,
            therefore:
          </p>
          <p>
            Resolved I --That the Trustees hereby invest the President with official
            authority to superintend and enforce the general discipline and
            management of the College, in all its departments, and that they will
            sustain him in the judicious exercise of such authority <PageNumber num={259} /> that they regard him as the official organ of communication between
            themselves and the faculty, and the students and that they will give due
            consideration, to the plans and suggestions for promoting the interests
            of the College which he may from time to time present.
          </p>
          <p>
            II.  That his official position requires him to observe and direct and
            by all proper methods promote the efficiency of all the students in all
            the classes and that he be required therefore occasionally to attend
            upon all the recitations of all the classes making such enquiries and
            suggestions as he may deem necessary or profitable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provided that nothing in this resolution shall be construed as
            interfering with the rights of any professor, in the special control of
            his own department in the selection of text books, methods of
            instruction, standards of merit &amp; proficiency or discipline of the
            classroom.
          </p>
          <p>
            III.  That when occasion shall arise for any extra services, not
            specifically devolving upon any particular member of the faculty, or
            when there shall be difficulty as to adjusting conflicting studies or
            hours of recitation of the several classes after consultation with the
            faculty or with the students or Professors interested the decision of
            the President shall be final.
          </p>
          <p>
            IV.  That the President be requested from time to time to visit the
            hotels and observe that the tables and fare and the conduct of the <PageNumber num={260} /> students are in accordance with the regulations of the College, and
            that he and the Professors, as he may request, shall from time to time
            visit the rooms of the resident students with a view to their neatness
            and good order and to the general behaviour [sic] of their occupants.
          </p>
          <p>
            V.  That all incidental repairs needed on the College premises, during
            term time, be ordered according to his judgment by the President.
          </p>
          <p>
            VI.  That at each annual meeting of the Board of Trustees, the President
            be required to present a report of the Condition and operations of the
            College and to give his views frankly as to the efficiency and
            suitableness of each College officer in his separate department, and
            such other information or suggestions as he may deem important  to the
            prosperity of the School and the effective working of its several
            departments.
          </p>
          <p>
            VIII. [sic]  That a copy of these resolutions be placed in the hands of

            The President presented the applications for professor and testimonials
            of the candidates for Greek Professorship, which being read<aside>Greek Professor</aside> and
            considered, the Board<aside>W.T Lockthan</aside> proceded to cast their ballots, and it was found
            that no one of the Candidates had received a majority of the votes.
            Thereupon the Board proceeded to cast the second ballot, which being
            counted it was found that Mr. Wm.T. Lockthan had received 10 out of 15,
            the whole number cast. He was accordingly declared duly elected to the
            professorship of Greek in the College.
          </p>
          <p>
            The President now presented the applications and recommendations of the
            Candidates for the Tutorship, which having<aside>Tutor</aside> also been read, and the vote
            taken by ballot, it was found that Mr. Chs S. Yarbrough had received a

            The Committee on Building appointed at the last meeting presented the
            following report which was adopted.
          </p>
          <p>Report</p>
          <p>
            The Committee appointed by the Board of Trustees of Richmond College to
            consider and report on the expedience and practicability of immediately
            entering the Centre Building of the College Edifice <PageNumber num={262} /> having given the subject such consideration as they were able, beg
            leave to submit the following report.
          </p>
          <aside>On completing College Edifice</aside>
          <p>
            That the interest and prosperity of the College manifestly require, that
            suitable rooms should be provided for Library, Laboratory - Chapel -
            Society Halls and Recitation Rooms all of which are now either entirely
            wanting or sadly inadequate to the needs of the institution. They
            consider these additional apartments essential to the progressive
            efficiency of the School. The admirable plan of the Center Building
            provides suitable accommodations for all these purposes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Committee also report that having conferred with some of the Master
            builders of the City, they are assured that the Buildings can be erected
            during the present season, enclosed by the<time dateTime="10-01"></time> first of October, and
            completed by the<time dateTime="1861-01-01"></time> first of January, 1861.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Committee therefore recommend that a Building Committee be
            appointed and instructed to advertise for proposals for the erection and
            completion of the Main Central Building of the College Edifice according
            to the plan and specifications of the architect as speedily as may be
            prudently practicable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Committee further report that they have reason to believe that the
            building can be erected and completed by giving the notes of the College
            (bearing interest) payable at four, eight, twelve and sixteen months
            from the date of completion of the building.
          </p>
          <p>
            They therefore respectfully recommend that in order to meet such notes
            when <PageNumber num={263} /> matured, the property owned by the College in Chicago be sold by the
            Agent of the Trustees, that the land owned by the College in Henrico,
            lying south of Franklin Street and north of the old Scuffletown road, be
            also sold, and the proceeds applied towards the cost of erecting the
            Central Building, and that whatever additional amount may be needed to
            meet the liabilities incurred, be raised from any uninvested funds in
            the hands of the Treasurer, from such bonds yet unpaid as may be
            collected, or from such invested fund as may be legally appropriated to
            this object or by loan to be replaced at such time as may be prescribed
            by the Board of Trustees.
          </p>
          <p>All of which is respectfully submitted</p>

            The President presented a communication<aside>Prof Louthan Resigns.</aside> from Prof. Louthan offering his
            resignation of the Professorship of Greek in the College owing to the
            failure of his health.
          </p>
          <p>
            On motion the following preamble and resolutions offered by Rev. A.M.
            Poindexter were unanimously adopted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whereas the fracture of his health has caused<aside>Complementary Resolutions</aside> Prof. Louthan to tender
            his resignation as professor of Greek in Richmond College. Therefore,
            Resolved  That the Board regret the cessation of his connection with the
            College, and tender to him their sincere sympathy in his affliction,
            with the hope that he may be soon restored to health.
          </p>
          <p>2.  That his resignation be accepted.</p>
          <p>3.  That the Secretary transmit a copy of these resolutions to him.</p>
          <p>
            He suggested that Mr. Crawford H. Toy would be a suitable person to
            supply the vacancy this created in the faculty, but <PageNumber num={268} /> that he was endeavoring to raise funds for the purpose of being sent
            as a missionary<aside>C.H Toy Elected Professor</aside> to Japan, and it was probable only a conditional
            arrangement could be made with him. On motion he was unanimously
            appointed to supply the vacancy in the Department of Greek with the
            proviso that should he desire at any time during the session to be
            released for the purpose of going to Japan, the Board would comply with
            his request.
          </p>
          <p>Absent A. Thomas &amp; A.G. Wortham.</p>
          <p>
            The President presented a petition from Lindsay (Hotel Keeper)
            requesting the Trustees<aside>to pay</aside> a bill incurred in having closet built in his
            hotel, as the work was done without authority from the Board, and for
            Mr. Lindsay’s own convenience, the Board refused to pay it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following resolutions offered by Rev. A.M. Poindexter were adopted.
          </p>
          <p>
            1.  Resolved  That the President of the College be, and he is hereby
            instructed by private correspondence, to look out and recommend to the
            Board one or more persons suitable in his judgment to become a permanent
            Professor of Greek in the College.
          </p>
          <p>
            2.  That it is desirable, if not absolutely necessary, that such
            Professor be a member of a Baptist Church.
          </p>
          <p>The following resolution by same, was also adopted.</p>
          <p>
            Resolved  That the Treasurer of the<aside>Treasurer to pay bills not authenticated</aside> be and is hereby instructed
            hereafter to pay out no money unless upon bills property certified.
          </p>
          <PageNumber num={269} />
          <p>
            A communication was presented through Rev. A.M. Poindexter from Dr. A.J.
            Coons relation to Mr. E. Adkins late Professor of Greek in the College,
            and the following action taken.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whereas a letter from Dr. A.J. Coons of St. Louis, Mo. to Rev. A.M.
            Poindexter and a statement from Prof. Adkins late Professor in Richmond
            College have been laid before the Board, from which it appears that
            Prof. Adkins claims to have sustained a loss of not less than $200.00 by
            reason of his connection with the College and whereas it is stated in
            the letter of Dr. Coons that Prof. Adkins has some doubt as to the<aside>Adkins appeal</aside>
            feelings of the Board towards him as a reason why it might be proper to
            make an appropriation for his benefit.
          </p>
          <p>
            <u>Therefore</u>
            1st  That the Board cherish the kindest feelings toward Prof. Adkins,
            late Professor of Greek in Richmond College.
          </p>
          <p>
            2nd -- That the Board do not recognize any <u>moral,</u>as certainly
            they are under no <u>legal</u>, obligation to refund to Prof. Adkins any
            loss which he may have sustained in consequence of his connection with
            the College since he accepted the apportionment after explicit
            information from the President as to what he would be entitled from the
            endowment fund and what amount had been paid, the previous year from the
            tuition fees to his predecessor.
          </p>
          <p>On motion the Board now adjourned.</p>

          <p>To the Trustees of Richmond College, Richmond, Va</p>
          <p>Gentlemen</p>
          <p>
            Although I have not<aside>Poindexter Accepts Agency</aside> received official notification of my election as
            agent for the College, yet having been present when the election was
            made and as another Board has requested my services and is anxious for
            an early decision I address you this, trusting it will not be regarded
            as premature or indelicate.
          </p>
          <p>
            While I would prefer other service which is offered me, yet the
            necessity for prompt in [sic] vigorous in behalf of the College decides
            me to accept the agency for it provided the Board meet necessary
            expenses and the conditions which I now specify are acceptable.
          </p>
          <p>
            1st, I must be supplied by the Board with whatever funds are needed <PageNumber num={286} /> for outfit and traveling expenses and such portions of salary as I
            may need from time to time.
          </p>
          <p>
            2nd, I am to be allowed full discretion as to expenses, and also as to
            the time which I may spend with my family -- No part of the expenses are
            to be deducted from my Salary.
          </p>
          <p>
            3rd, I am to have full authority to engage at the cost of the Board such
            assistance as I may find necessary to the speedy and successful
            consummation of the objects of the agency.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am thus explicit, because I cannot myself advance the money necessary
            for outfit &amp;c and unless the Board can do so, shall thereby be
            estopped from engaging the work and because regarding the other matters
            an explicit understanding now will prevent liability to misunderstanding
            hereafter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should the appointment under the above condition be confirmed, I shall
            be willing to enter upon active services as soon as I can arrange my
            private affairs for that purpose.
          </p>
          <p>An immediate reply is respectfully requested.</p>
          <p>Yours respectfully,</p>
          <p>A.M. Poindexter</p>
          <p>
            On motion the Secretary was instructed to inform A.M. Poindexter the
            Board accepted the conditions as set forth in his letter above, and
            confirmed the apportionment.

          <PageNumber num={287} />

            Resolved that W. Goddin be requested<aside>Chicago Property</aside> to open a correspondence with our

            selling at an early day, the lots in that City belonging to the College
            -- and that said agents be instructed to sell said lots at auction
            without delay unless in their opinion a sale at this time would be

            which was unanimously adopted.

            I.  That the unselfish devotion of President Ryland to the interest of
            the College from its foundation to the present time meets the gratitude
            of its friends and <PageNumber num={288} /> all the friends of education in Virginia amid all the struggles, he
            has pursued<aside>Complimentary Resolution to Dr. Ryland</aside> the same undeviating course seeking only to promote its
            elevation and to extend its influence. The large numbers of its alumni
            filling various positions of usefulness in this state and in other
            states are witnesses of the sound, liberal education secured within its
            walls under his administration. The Baptist Churches of the South are
            especially indebted to him for the judicious training through which many
            of their most esteemed and efficient Ministers have passed while
            identified with the College. These Ministers in common with other
            classes of students, have not ceased to bear towards him, as their
            faithful instructor, feelings of unfeigned respect and reverence.
          </p>
          <p>
            II.  In sundering the relation which has so long and so pleasantly
            subsisted, the Trustees hereby express their sincere and unabated
            personal esteem for the many excellencies of character uniting in their
            late President. They will not cease to follow him with their best wishes
            for the prosperity of himself and family and to pray that he may yet see
            many years of usefulness and happiness in his endeavors to promote the
            cause of education and the interests of religion.
          </p>
          <p>
            III.  That the Secretary be instructed to transmit to President Ryland a
            copy of the above preamble and resolutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Resolved  That the above be published in the Religious Herald and other
            papers of the City --

            At a meeting of the Trustees of Richmond College held this afternoon at
            Grace Street Baptist Church
          </p>
          <p>
            Present  Ro. Ryland, Prest., James Thomas, Jr., James B. Taylor, Edwin
            Wortham, Josiah Ryland, J.B. Jeter, C.H. Winston, A.G. Wortham, J.A.
            Chambliss, L.R. Spilman and A.R. Courtney, Trustees, and T.G. Jones and
            H.H. Harris of the Faculty.
          </p>
          <p>Prayer by Rev. J.B. Taylor</p>
          <p>
            The committee appointed at the last meeting to consider and report upon
            the subject of future arrangements with the Faculty as to residences,
            salaries &amp;c and other subjects -- presented the following report.
          </p>
          <aside>Report on Residences Faculty</aside>
          <p>
            The committee to whom was referred the question of a proper disposition
            of the Buildings &amp; lots connected with College premises - the report
            of the General Agent and sundry other matters beg leave to report.
          </p>
          <ol style={{ listStylePosition: 'outside' }}>
            <li>
              In relation to the dwellings the committee recommend that the house now
              occupied by the President with grounds attached to it be appropriated to
              the sole use of the President, and that in view of the claim which <PageNumber num={308} />
              which the other members of the Faculty have upon this building and
              grounds. The committee recommend that the Trustees grant <u>rent fee</u> the
              house and lot occupied by Professor Puryear in place
              thereof and that this house and lot, with the house and lot now occupied
              by Professor Harrison be assigned to the Professors to be so jointly
              occupied &amp; arranged as to them may be most agreeable. This plan of
              adjustment though not in perfect accordance with understanding of the
              Professor as to their proper claim still meets with their concurrence.
              They express a willingness to submit to the arrangement.
            </li>
            <li>
              In reference to the Agent’s report, the committee beg leave to state
              that they have given serious and prolonged attention to the facts
              involved, especially to the threatened embarrassment of the College by
              the deficiency of funds to meet the expenses of the year just closed and
              the probable recurrence of a similar deficiency in the year to come.
              They were satisfied that the obligations under which the Trustees have
              placed themselves to the President and Professors could not be met
              without involving the College in a heavy debt which could be constantly
              augmenting and which would seriously impede the work of filling up the
              endowment if it did not imperil the actual continuance of the
              Institution. They saw no escape in the present condition <PageNumber num={309} />
              of the times, but in an appeal to the President and Professors
              themselves asking them to consider the expediency of so far abating
              their claim upon the Trustees for the coming year as to bearing the
              current expenses within limits easily controlled. In deciding upon this
              course, while they confided in the magnanimity of the President &amp;
              Professors, they believed that a present sacrifice on their part would
              be ultimately promotive of their interest well as to the interest of
              the College.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <aside>Salaries Faculty.</aside>
          <p>
            The committee are happy to report that their consultation with the
            Faculty was free and pleasant. The President &amp; Professors seemed to
            apprehend the present &amp; prospective exegencies [sic] of the College
            and expressed a willingness to yield to a proper abatement of their
            claims. It was finally proposed by them to diminish on the part of the
            President the sum of $300 and on the part of the Professor each $250,
            making a sum total of $1300 which the Faculty agree to relinquish, so
            that instead of $2,000, the President will receive seventeen hundred
            dollars as the stipulated salary for the coming year, and instead of
            $1,000 to be paid as salary to each of the Professors, they will receive
            each the sum $750. The whole of the tuition fees are to be as heretofore
            equally divided between the President &amp; Professors. The committee
            recommend that the Trustees concur in the arrangement. If it shall be
            carried out and the Chicago property be advantageously <PageNumber num={310} />
            sold, the hope may be reasonably entertained, that any remaining
            indebtedness will be entirely under the control of the Board. It is
            however of the utmost importance that with a cautious regard to the
            solvency of the Institution and its final success, no liabilities be
            incurred which may not be met from the income of the endowment and
            incidental fund. An encroachment upon the endowment itself, excepting
            under circumstances of extreme necessity must not be allowed.
          </p>
          <p>
            It will be understood that the arrangement this proposed is to be valid
            only for the ensuing scholastic year and that notice shall hereby be
            given to the President and Professors of Richmond College, that before
            the close of the session, other propositions will be presented for their
            acceptance -- propositions as liberal as the finances of the Institution
            will justify and which we hope will be commensurate with the eminent
            qualifications of the Faculty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The committee have also had under consideration the paper addressed to
            the Trustees by the Faculty in relation to the imployment [sic] of
            assistant instructors for the primary classes in connection with any of
            the schools which may need this assistance. The Faculty propose to
            select such instructors subject to the appointment of the Board. They
            also expect to sustain the entire expense of these instructors and to
            hold them amenable to themselves.
          </p>
          <PageNumber num={311} />
          <aside>Assistant Instructors</aside>
          <p>
            The committee recommend that in any case when the more efficient
            instruction in any school shall seem to require it the Faculty may
            nominate for appointment an assisted instructor and that the Trustees
            should in such case be prepaired [sic] to consider the application with
            respect, and if deemed appropriate, should confer the appointment with
            the understanding that the expense of such instruction is to be borne by
            the Faculty, and that the instructor is to be responsible to them for
            the faithful discharge of his duty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another paper presented by the Faculty, asking for authority to throw
            two of the rooms on the second floor of the College building <u>into one</u> by
            removing a partition, has been considered by the
            committee. In view of having a larger room for the Latin School, the
            committee recommend that the desired authority be given, provided that
            the change can be made without injuring the building.
          </p>
          <p>All of which is respectfully submitted.</p>
          <div>Signed, James B. Taylor, Chairman</div>
          <p>On motion of L.R. Spilman, the report was approved and adopted.</p>
          <p>
            A letter from W. Goddin in reference to the sale of the real estate of
            the College in Chicago, and also a letter from the agent in Chicago were
            read and on motion the President of the Board was directed to renew the
            Note for $1100 in the Planters National Bank in order to give further
            time for its payment from the sale of that property and on motion of <PageNumber num={312} />
            James Thomas, Jr., Rev. Jas B. Taylor was requested to go by Chicago
            on his visit to the West and look after the property of the College in
            that City and have it sold if possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            On motion of Jas B. Taylor, it was resolved that a committee of five be
            appointed to consider the expediency of constituting an <u>“Executive Committee”</u> from the Board of Trustees for the
            transaction of the ordinary business of the Board.
          </p>
          <p>
            A.R. Courtney, J.A. Chambliss, Josiah Ryland, R.T. Coleman and A.G.
            Wortham were appointed the committee.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Jones in behalf of the Faculty, reported adversely to the
            application of C.T. Bailey for honorary degree of the College.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon an inquiry of the Faculty, whether they or the Board should pay the
            bill of the Religious Herald for advertising for the last year, it was
            ordered that the Board should pay for the advertising up to the
            beginning of last session in October 1866 after which the Board
            adjourned.

            Mr. Goddin made a statement in regard to the sale of the lots in Chicago

          <p>
            This shows a balance of $3341.59 against the College <time dateTime="1868-07-01">1st July 1868</time> should all the interested be collected: but it would not be safe to
            depend upon the collection by  <PageNumber num={321} />
            that time of more than two thirds of it. It is probable however that
            bonds may be obtained by the Agent increasing somewhat the amount then
            to become due.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Agent has secured bonds amounting to $73447 and annual pledges for
            five years equal to the interest on $2583 and for life equal to the
            interest on $1600 -- in all $77630. -- But there has been paid of
            principal of the bonds a considerable amount, so that not more than
            $75000 can be now at interest. In addition to this the College owns
            about $25000 of Va. State and other bonds, of which the Va. bonds pay
            interest regularly.
          </p>
          <aside>Authority to borrow $4000.</aside>
          <p>
            In view of the necessity for paying the bank debt, and meeting as far as
            practical the wants of the Faculty your committee recommend that an
            effort be made to borrow the sum of $4000, and that the Va. State bonds
            or so much thereof as may me [sic] be requisite, be pledged as security
            for the loan.
          </p>
          <p>
            It should however be distinctly made known to the parties from whom it
            is proposed to make such loan, that the College will not expect to repay
            the money until it can realize from the sale of the Chicago lots.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Committee further recommend that a Special Agent be appointed to
            proceed to Chicago and endeavor to effect a sale of the lots there
            located.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seems useless longer to depend upon the Chicago Agents to effect a
            sale.
          </p>
          <PageNumber num={322} />
          <p>
            Another point to which your committee would call the special attention
            of of [sic] the Board is that at the rate of Salaries as now fixed, the
            College cannot be expected to have for some years, an income sufficient
            to prevent the accumulation of debt.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rate is, to the President $2000 per Annum and house rent, to each
            Professor $1000 per annum and a portion of the rent of the other
            dwellings. Now with present Faculty this requires $6000 per Annum,
            exclusive of incidentals and Expenses of Agency.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would in the judgement of your Committee, be unwise to expect more
            than $4500, the interest on $75,000 from the present Endowment; and any
            increase that can reasonably [be] hoped for will not be greater than
            will be needed to Constitute a sinking fund on which means to
            sustain the agency in the first place, and when that necessity shall
            cease, to replace the amount of principal used in Current expenses may
            be obtained.
          </p>
          <aside>Professors Salaries.</aside>
          <p>
            Until both these demands shall have been met it would be unsafe to
            pledge more than the amount indicated ($4500.) per annum to the support
            of Faculty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The College should not be allowed to go on accumulating debt, thus
            cripling [sic] it for an indefinite period and risking in fact its ruin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should the idea once take hold of the public mind that such a course is
            being pursued, it would stop all chance of increased Endowment.
          </p>
          <PageNumber num={323} />
          <p>
            Already the use of a portion of the principal for current Expenses,
            although only in the shape of a loan, to be replaced from income (as the
            Agent has represented it to be) has had an injurious effect. Looking at
            the interest of the Faculty alone, it would be better for them that the
            Board pledge only $4500 and pay it than that it should pledge a larger
            sum and not pay it. Especially, as by the former course it is to be
            hoped it will sooner be in the power of the College to pay increased
            Salaries.
          </p>
          <aside>Professors Salaries</aside>
          <p>
            The sum proposed would give to each Professor $750 and to the President
            $1500. per Annum divided at the rates as now fixed by the Board.
          </p>
          <p>
            This would be within two hundred dollars of which the Faculty
            voluntarily agreed to accept the present term.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your Committee beg leave to state that while they think the Board
            should, as we are sure they are disposed to do, use every effort for the
            prompt payment of Salaries, yet should it be found impracticable to
            effect this, the Faculty should not feel aggrieved, as they knew at the
            time of accepting their appointments, that the Board was without
            resources and that the attempt to secure them was an experiment -- an
            experiment far more successful that [sic] could have been expected had
            it been known that the Condition of the Country would be as it is. Nor
            do your Committee anticipate any unpleasant feeling <PageNumber num={324} />
            on this account, or as the result of such measures herein recommended
            as are necessary to the more speedy and efficient establishment of the
            College on a firm foundation. The Gentlemen of the Faculty have shown a
            high appreciation of the important trust Committed to them and a general
            Concurrence with the Board and Agent in efforts to secure endowment, and
            to lessen expenses, especially by the voluntary relinquishment of $1300
            Salaries for present term.

            Report of the Committee on resignation of Dr. Jones adopted June 16,

          </h3>
          <ol>
            <li className='resolved1'>
              That we deeply regret this resignation of his professorship
              by Rev. Tiberius G. Jones D.D, who has, for three years, presided over
              this College and filled one of its most important Chairs.
            </li>
            <li>
              That high as was our estimate of his capacity as a Professor of the
              Moral Course at the time of his appointment, our expectations have been
              fully realized and we take pleasure in bearing testimony to the great
              zeal and distinguished ability he has brought to the discharge of the
              duties of this office.
            </li>
            <li className='third'>
              3.  That President Jones’s devotion to the interests of this institution
              over which he was called to preside at a dark hour in its history and
              which he now leaves in a prosperous condition -- a devotion signalized
              alike by public speech and private effort -- calls for the expression of
              our sincere approval and that we feel it due to him and to ourselves to
              place on record this public acknowledgement of the fact.
            </li>
            <li>
              That we will follow him in new field of labor upon which he is about
              to enter, with our sincerest wishes <PageNumber num={351} />
              for his eminent prosperity and success.</li>
            <li>
              That a copy of these resolutions be furnished to President Jones and
              that they be published in the newspaper of the City of Richmond.

            desirable for their sons, and especially for their young men approved by
            their Churches as candidates for the Gospel Ministry. The Trustees
            pledge themselves to receive students from <PageNumber num={363} />
            West Va. whether preparing for the Ministry or other liberal
            professions, upon precisely the same conditions, with the same
            privileges and to furnish them the same aids and facilities as their own
            sons.

          <p>
            The President laid before the meeting a communication from the Sheriff

            Boisseau against the College amounting to $870.64 and stated that the

            means to enlarge accommodations for students at Richmond College.
            Prof Puryear was invited to take a seat with the Board and to take part
            in its proceedings. Information being asked for Prof. Puryear submitted
            a statement of the number of students and the number of rooms at the
            College and explained the present arrangements for this accommodation.
            He showed the want of more room.

          <aside>Stocks to Sold</aside>
          <p>
            Whereupon Jas. Thomas Jr. stated that the Treasurer held bonds of Va.
            and Tenn. R.R. and the Corporation of Portsmouth, which had paid no
            interest for several years and which he learned might possibly be
            disposed of at reasonable rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            On motion of Jas. Thomas Jr. it was Resolved That the Treasurer be
            instructed to sell the Va. and Tenn bonds amounting to $3,500 and the
            Portsmouth Corporation stock of $500.
          </p>

          <p>On motion of the same—it was</p>
          <p>
            Resolved—that the Treasurer be instructed after the payment of the
            execution out of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds to pay over the
            balance to the Committee on the premises to be expended by them in the
            erection of Cottages.
          </p>
          <p>On motion of T.J. Evans, it was</p>
          <p>
            Resolved that the Committee on the Premises be instructed to proceed at
            once in the erection of at least two Brick four room Cottages, on the
            lawn at such places as they may select.
          </p>
          <p>
            The General Agent stated that he was doubtful about his retaining the
            General Agency as the College could not be much benefitted in money and
            wished candidly to know the opinion of the Board.
          </p>
          <PageNumber num={365} />
          <p>
            After an interchange of views and full deliberation, on Motion T.J.
            Evans the following resolution was adopted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Resolved that in the opinion of the Trustees, although we may not look
            to any immediate considerable receipt of money from the efforts of the
            agency, it is expedient that Dr. Poindexter be continued as the Agent,
            and that he be instructed to direct his attention and efforts to the
            raising of a fund for building purposes, in such manners as he may deem
            wise and prudent for the present and the future interest of the College.
          </p>
          <p>On motion the Board adjourned.</p>

            satisfactory, about $2600.
          </p>

            Prof. Puryear made a statement in regard to the improvements which had
            been made under the management of the committee of the premises and
            final report on the expenditure for the same, which was referred to the
            auditory committee.
          </p>
          <PageNumber num={366} />
          <p>
            The Professor also made an interesting and encouraging statement of the

            after a free conversation between the members in regard to the College,
            and there being no business requiring action of the Board, the meeting

            The committees to whom was assigned the duty of preparing suitable
            Memorials of William Sands and E.J. Owen presented the following reports
            which were unanimously adopted.
          </p>
          <p>
            “William Sands was from the Organization of Richmond College to the time
            of his death a member of its Board of Trustees. He cherished a lively
            interest in its welfare, punctually attended the meetings of its Board,
            and faithfully discharge all his duties as trustee. The College and the
            cause of education in general are indebted to him for his long continued
            and earnest advocacy of their interest. His position as editor of the
            Religious Herald, which he occupied for more than thirty years, gave
            advantages for promoting those interests of which he zealously and
            disinterestedly availed himself. He was by birth and education an
            Englishman but coming in early life to Virginia, he identified himself
            with her people, especially with the Baptists of the State and became a
            useful and respected citizen. His death which occurred very suddenly,
            left a vacuum in his family, in the Church of which he was a Member, and
            in the Board of Trustees of Richmond College not easy to be filled. He
            was an intelligent, modest, pious, energetic man, and the Trustees of
            the College deem it due to his memory to place upon record this
            testament of their appreciation of his character and services.”
          </p>
          <PageNumber num={369} />
          <aside>Dr. Owen</aside>
          <p>
            "Edward Jarworth Owen was a native of Wales. He came to this country in
            his youth and completed his education at the theological seminary in
            Campton, Kentucky. About the year 1850 he settled in his first pastorate
            with a new Church in St. Louis. After remaining there some years, he was
            transferred to the Presidency of William Jewell College, in Clay Count,
            Missouri. Of his labors in this position we have no information. About
            the close of the war, his health failed. After lingering sometime with
            pulmonary disease, he died.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dr. Owen was a man of astute mind, varied learning, considerable
            research and great energy. He died comparatively young. Had he lived to
            old age, he would have distinguished himself by his attainments and
            labors. As it was, he had secured the title L.L.D. a distinction he
            doubtless merited. He laid Richmond College under lasting obligations by
            bequeathing to it his library containing 2597 volumes and estimated to
            be worth $5,000.
          </p>
          <p>
            The gift was the more valuable as it was received soon after the close
            of the war, during which the College library had been greatly scattered
            and reduced. The bequest should be the more highly estimated because it
            was made by a stranger, who sympathized with us in our poverty and
            embarrassments. Your committee  suggest that it would be a proper and
            becoming memorial of the magnificent and timely gift of Dr. Owen to
            separate the library and call it by his
            <br /><span style={{ display: 'block', textAlign: 'right', textDecoration: 'underline' }}>over</span>
            <PageNumber num={370} /> name. Such a measure would not only be a just honor to his memory but
            might an incentive to others to imitate his noble example.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Secretary was requested to provide copy of the report for
            publication in the Religious Herald.
